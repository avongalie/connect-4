# connect-4

### Overview:
I have decided to design an in-browser version of the popular game connect 4.

### Game rules:
My connect 4 will follow the classic rules. There are 2 players. 1 is in charge of yellow pieces and the other is in charge of red pieces. Both players take turns dropping pieces in a 7 x 6 board. Whoever gets 4 pieces in a row vertically, horizontally or diagonally wins the game. Each win is desginated as a point.

### User stories: 
User begins by inputting their name and player 2's name and press play to begin the game. Users then take turns dropping their pieces and can choose bewteen mouse and keyboard controls. Mouse controls work by hovering over one of the 7 columns where a piece will show up and players can decide where to drop it. Keyboard controls work by having a column selected and allowing users to move their selections right and left using arrow keys or wasd.
When a player wins by having 4 pieces in a row, a win screen will appear.

### MVP checklist: 
- Allows 2 player functionality and allows players to choose names.
- Has different color tiles for each player.
- Displays a 7 x 6 game board.
- Allows a player to win when getting 4 pieces in a row.

### Stretch goals: 
- Have an animation on the game board when the game begins.
- Have an animation between player turns.
- Have a restart button for the game and to change player names.
- Allow players to choose color scheme.
